                    <h2>Front-End vs. Back-End Development</h2>
                    <p>When it comes to building websites and web applications, there are two main areas of development: front-end and back-end. While both are important, they involve different skill sets and focus on different aspects of the development process.</p>
                    <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
                    <p>Front-end development, also known as client-side development, is the part of the development process that focuses on the user interface and user experience of a website or web application. Front-end developers use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the visual and interactive elements that users see and interact with. This includes things like layout, typography, colors, buttons, forms, and animations.</p>
                    <h3>Back-End Development</h3>
                    <p>Back-end development, also known as server-side development, is the part of the development process that focuses on the behind-the-scenes functionality of a website or web application. Back-end developers use programming languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, and Java to create the logic and functionality that powers the website or web application. This includes things like database management, user authentication, server configuration, and API integration.</p>
                    <p>Both front-end and back-end development are important for creating a successful website or web application. While front-end development focuses on the user interface and user experience, back-end development focuses on the functionality and performance of the website or web application. Together, they create a seamless and enjoyable experience for users.</p>

                    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
                    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page and its content, and is used to create headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and other elements.</p>

                    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
                    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. CSS separates the presentation of a document from its content, and is used to style fonts, colors, layouts, and other visual aspects of a web page.</p>

                    <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
                    <p>JavaScript is a programming language used to create interactive and dynamic web pages. It is used to add functionality to a web page, such as validating forms, creating animations, and responding to user events. JavaScript can be used to manipulate HTML and CSS, and can also be used to communicate with servers and databases.</p>
